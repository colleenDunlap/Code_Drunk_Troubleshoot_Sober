# Code_Drunk_Edit_Sober
Ernest Hemingway Once Said "Write Drunk, Edit Sober."  This is the Software Engineering Version of That.  Will the inhibition of drinking 2 glasses of wine/pints of beer before coding yield faster product development?  Or will it lead to gross, unmanageable code and unreadable variable and function names?  Let's find out.

Ok, I know this will may sound bad to all the tech recruiters who followed a link in my resume to my GitHub.  But I promise, this is testing an age old Dev-ops philosophy of the merits of planning-heavy development methods (e.g waterfall) vs agile/incremental development methods (e.g. agile), in a way that limits experimental error by letting programmers compare their drunk selves (i.e. rapid development selves) to their sober selves (i.e. planning-heavy selves).  In oversimplification, when we have an idea for the feature, do we implement first and think later, or think first and implement after everything's figured out.  I'd also like to think we're doing all the startups with "Beer Fridays" a favor by analyzing whether the mid-day beer is a worthwhile perk.

I'll be keeping a diary every time I make major edits to this code base, with qualitative information on whether I generated output faster or slower than normal (and quantitative information on how much I drank and how good I perceived my output to be).

This Repo will include multiple folders each corresponding to a different project.

All contributions are welcome!  I trust that you are honest in drinking before you push (whatever amount it takes to make you feel as if you're "coding drunk (or tipsy)"  Just make sure you record your contribution in the "diaries" folder of the project that you are creating/editing.
