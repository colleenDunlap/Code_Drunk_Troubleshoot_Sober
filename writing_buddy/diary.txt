Description: I'm incredibly excited because this is the first project-based commit of the code_drunk_troubleshoot_sober repository.  I'm currently in an Algorithms class where we are creating a project that reads in PDFs and outputs either 1) repetitive words/phrases to guide language or content learners or 2) suggests alternatives to repetitive language to make your writing more engaging to readers.  So far we've already created a means of reading the pdf's.  Now I am going to try to store all the words in the pdf in a HashTable that maps the word to its occurence within the pdf.

How Drunk I Feel (scale 1-10, 1 being sober, 10 being a Hangover Movie remake):
